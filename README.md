To use:

**1.** Download the two files "TS_Save_11.json" & "TS_Save_11.png".

**2.** Place them into, Documents -> My Games -> Tabletop Simulator -> Saves.

**3.** Edit the file in that directory named "SaveFileInfos.json" and add this *(updating the directory to point to yours since it's not likely in the E drive.)* :
```
{
    "Directory": "E:\\Documents//My Games//Tabletop Simulator//Saves\\TS_Save_11.json",
    "Name": "11 - TheRealms-4-11 - 4/11/2020 2:01:13 PM",
    "UpdateTime": 1586628073
  }
```
 after the last line of code similar to this:
 ```
     "UpdateTime": 1586221099
  },
```

*This may require a restart of TTS but shouldn't*
